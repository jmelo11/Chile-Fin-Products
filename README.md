# ChileFinance
Python tools for the chilean financial market.

Alpha project. For the excel files to work, you need to install the xlwings add-in. For the postgre connection, pyscopg2 and sqlachemy libraries are needed. A good way to go is using anaconda package manager.


Any contribution is welcome.
